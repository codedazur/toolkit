# useIncreasedContrast

component with the latest setting.

import { useState } from 'react'
import { useIncreasedContrast } from '@codedazur/react-preferences'

export function Demo() {
  const increasedContrast = useIncreasedContrast()

  return (
    <p>User prefers increased contrast: {String(increasedContrast)}</p>
  )
}
```
